# Task Overview

You are required to demonstrate your proficiency in software development practices, focusing on environment setup, build automation, and CI/CD pipeline configuration. Your task involves a C++ project hosted in a Git repository, which includes a test suite using Google Test.

## Objectives

1. **Environment Setup and Local Execution:**
- a sample c++ program is provided which starts the webcam and performs basic face detection. Rudementry unit-test is included in the /tests folder
   - Pull the latest code from the provided Git repository (if you're reading this - that's probably done already)
   - fork the repo and work on your fork - this will be your submission when done.
   - Set up a local development environment necessary to build and run the provided C++ program and its test suite. We used GoogleTest and opencv 4.8.0.
   - Ensure that you can build the program and run the tests successfully on your local machine.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:**
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using a framework of your choice (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, etc.).
   - Configure the pipeline to automatically build the program and run the test suite upon any new commit to the main branch.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Write a summary (approximately half a page) detailing your process, the choices you made, and any challenges you encountered. Include instructions on how future developers can use your setup.

## Submission

- Submit the URL to your fork of the repository, with the CI/CD pipeline configuration included.
- Include your summary document as a Markdown file (you are welcome to edit this file for that purpose).
